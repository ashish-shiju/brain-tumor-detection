# Brain Tumor Detection üß†
**Duration**: Dec 2020 to May 2021

This project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors from MRI scans. Using Python libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, the model identifies whether an MRI scan contains a brain tumor with high accuracy.

## üîç How It Works

1.  **Data Preprocessing**:
    
    *   MRI scan images are resized, normalized, and converted to grayscale to prepare them for model training.
        
    *   Labels are assigned based on the presence or absence of a tumor.
        
2.  **Model Architecture**:
    
    *   A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend.
        
    *   The network consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction and fully connected layers for classification.
        
3.  **Training**:
    
    *   The model is trained on the labeled dataset using supervised learning.
        
    *   Cross-entropy loss is minimized using the Adam optimizer.
        
4.  **Detection**:
    
    *   The trained model predicts whether an MRI scan contains a tumor.
        
    *   The results are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
        

## üß† Concepts Explained

*   **Supervised Learning**:The project uses labeled MRI data to train the CNN. Each image is paired with a label indicating whether it contains a tumor.
    
*   **Convolutional Neural Networks**:CNNs are ideal for image classification tasks. They extract spatial hierarchies of features through layers of convolutions, pooling, and activation functions.
    
*   **Metrics**:
    
    *   **Training Accuracy**: 99%
        
    *   **Validation Accuracy**: Between 89% and 92%
        
    *   Evaluated using a confusion matrix and loss plots.
